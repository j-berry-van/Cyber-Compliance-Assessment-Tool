# CSF Profile — Free, Open-Source NIST CSF 2.0 Assessment Tool

A free, open-source, self-hosted toolkit for running NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 profile assessments — a lightweight alternative to commercial GRC platforms. Track outcomes, assign ownership, document observations and findings, score current and target states, and export for visualization. Run it locally with your data staying in your browser, or self-host it for a team on your own server (see [Two ways to run it](#two-ways-to-run-it)).

**[🚀 Try the Live Demo](https://csf-profile-app.pages.dev)** — no install required. Explore a populated assessment of the fictional company "Alma Security" in seconds.

## Your Capstone in 5 Steps

Building your GRC portfolio artifact for a Simply Cyber Academy course? Here's the whole arc:

1. **Open the app** — [csf-profile-app.pages.dev](https://csf-profile-app.pages.dev) (no install), or pick another door below.
2. **Explore the sample** — a comprehensive CSF 2.0 assessment for fictional "Alma Security" is pre-loaded; check the Dashboard radar to see where you're headed.
3. **Score your scope** — pick your subcategories and score current vs. target state using the built-in [0-10 scoring legend](#scoring-system).
4. **Document observations and findings** — record what you examined, who you interviewed, what you tested, and link evidence artifacts.
5. **Export and report** — export your CSV workpapers and write up results; use the [example audit report](ASSESSMENT_CATALOG/6_Audit_Report/) as your template. That deliverable is your portfolio piece.

## Two ways to run it

The same app runs in two modes. The mode is fixed when the app is built.

| | **Local / desktop** (default) | **Self-hosted multi-user** |
|---|---|---|
| Who it is for | One person, one machine; the hosted demo; the Tauri desktop app | A team assessing together |
| Where data lives | In your browser's localStorage. Nothing is uploaded. | In a SQLite file on **your own server**, shared by every account |
| Accounts | None | Sign-in with admin-created accounts (no self-signup) |
| Collaboration | Export / import files | Shared workspace, automatic saving, conflict prompts when two people edit the same record, a "last edited by" line on each assessment |
| Setup | `npm start` (below) | Build with `REACT_APP_SERVER_MODE=true`, run `server/` with `MULTIUSER=true`, or use the Dockerfile |

In multi-user mode the organization profile (crown jewels, security tooling) is saved to your server too, and every
account on it can see it. Treat your server as the new place that data lives and back it up. Local mode behaves exactly
as before.

- Self-hosting guide (build, run, HTTPS, Docker, backups, password recovery): [docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md)
- Using it as a team (accounts, linking participants, conflicts, importing a browser's data): [docs/MULTI_USER.md](docs/MULTI_USER.md)
- Design and the decisions behind it: [multi-user design spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-multi-user-server-storage-design.md)

### Architecture at a glance

- **Client**: a React app. Each data store is persisted with zustand. In local mode it writes to localStorage; in
  server mode a sync engine writes per-record changes to the server (with an outbox so edits survive being offline),
  polls for other people's changes about every 20 seconds, and shows a Saving / Unsaved indicator. A few per-browser
  settings (theme, AI settings, current assessment, acting user, cloud-AI consent) stay in localStorage.
- **Server** (`server/`, optional in local mode): Express 5. In multi-user mode it adds accounts and sessions, a
  records API with optimistic versioning, and a one-time import of a browser's existing data, all backed by SQLite.
  In every mode it hosts the AI proxy, which keeps the Claude API key off the browser.

## 🚪 Choose Your Door

The same NIST CSF 2.0 guidance, flattened into proper tables, ships in four formats. Pick the one that fits how you work — you don't need to install the app to get value from this repo:

| Door | Best for | Start here |
|------|----------|------------|
| 📊 **Spreadsheets** | Excel / Power Query users; feeding your AI assistant; zero-tooling quick start | [GET_THE_SPREADSHEETS/](GET_THE_SPREADSHEETS/) |
| 📝 **Notion template** | Individuals and small teams who want a free, dynamic CSF database — no GRC tool budget needed | [GET_THE_NOTION_TEMPLATE/](GET_THE_NOTION_TEMPLATE/) |
| 💻 **React app** | Consultants and analysts who want a guided assessment workflow ([or just try the demo](https://csf-profile-app.pages.dev)) | [INSTALL_THE_APP/](INSTALL_THE_APP/) or [Installation](#installation-and-setup) below |
| 👥 **Team server** | A team that wants one shared workspace with accounts, on its own server | [docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md) |
| 🎓 **Practice case study** | Career-changers building a GRC portfolio — run a full assessment of fictional "Alma Security" | [ASSESSMENT_CATALOG/](ASSESSMENT_CATALOG/) |

## Installation and Setup

These steps run **local mode** (your data stays in your browser). For a shared team server, see [docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md).

### Walkthrough:

[![CSF Profile Assessment Tool Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xWo9owjk75c/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xWo9owjk75c)

### Installation:

[![Video Title](https://img.youtube.com/vi/h206z7wIYqY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/h206z7wIYqY)

### Prerequisites by Operating System

#### macOS

macOS typically comes with Git pre-installed. You only need to install Node.js:

1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
2. Verify installation by opening Terminal and running:

   ```
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

#### Windows

1. **Install Git first**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

   * During installation, you can accept the default options
2. **Install Node.js**: Download the MSI installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)

   * Run the MSI installer and follow the prompts
3. **Open PowerShell** to run the installation commands below

   * Press `Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell" or search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu

#### Kali Linux / Debian-based Linux

1. Update your package manager and install Node.js:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm git
   ```

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CPAtoCybersecurity/csf_profile
   cd csf_profile
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Encrypted Exports (.enc.csv)

Some exports support optional password protection. If you provide a password, the downloaded file will be named like:

- `assessments_YYYY-MM-DD.enc.csv`

This is an encrypted file format intended for secure backup/storage. It will not open directly in Excel/VS Code.

### How to decrypt

Use the provided Node script to decrypt an encrypted export back into a regular CSV:

**Note:** The script works on modern Node versions (Node 18+ recommended). On Node 22+ `globalThis.crypto` is read-only; the script handles this internally.

```bash
node scripts/decrypt-export.mjs --in <input.enc.csv> --out <output.csv>
```

Example:

```bash
node scripts/decrypt-export.mjs --in assessments_2026-01-19.enc.csv --out assessments_2026-01-19.csv
```

If the password is wrong (or the file is modified), decryption will fail.

Security note: Passing `--password` on the command line may save it in your shell history. If needed for automation, you can still provide `--password "..."`.

### Environment Variables Configuration (Optional)

The application uses an optional `.env` file for backend configuration. The only credential the app uses is the Claude AI Assistant key (server-side). Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to get started. (Multi-user server settings such as `MULTIUSER`, `DATA_DIR` and `COOKIE_SECURE` are listed in `server/env.example` and [docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md).)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Claude AI Assistant (server-side key)

The AI Assistant's Claude integration is configured **on the backend only** — the browser never sees or stores the API key:

- `CLAUDE_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key (used by the backend proxy at `/api/ai/claude`)
- `CLAUDE_MODEL` - Optional model override (defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)

Set these in the backend environment (or `.env`) and restart the server. The frontend shows a "Ready" badge when the key is configured (via `GET /api/ai/status`, which returns a boolean only). Without a key, Claude requests return a mock response so local development still works.

**Recommended: Using a `.env` file (All platforms)**

The easiest approach for all platforms is to use a `.env` file in the project root:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Edit `.env` and fill in your values
3. The `.env` file is automatically excluded from version control
4. Run `npm start` as normal

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Never share your API tokens publicly
- Rotate tokens periodically for security
- The `.env` file is already listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

### Troubleshooting (Kali Linux)

If you encounter issues with `react-scripts` not installing correctly on Kali Linux:

1. **Delete node_modules and reinstall:**

   ```bash
   cd csf_profile
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **If issues persist**, try installing with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag:

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. **Verify react-scripts is installed:**

   ```bash
   ls node_modules/.bin/ | grep react-scripts
   ```

#### Docker

A `Dockerfile` at the repository root builds the multi-user (server mode) image: it builds the client with
`REACT_APP_SERVER_MODE=true` and runs the server with accounts and a SQLite volume. See
[docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md#4-docker). The older draft files in `_future/docker/` are for reference
only and are not used.

## Export Options

File-based exports are generated in the browser and downloaded by it — no backend required in local mode:
- **CSV Export**: Import into Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet tool
- **JSON Export**: Import into Jira via the Jira Importers plugin, or use with other tools

## Features

### Multi-user mode (self-hosted)

* Sign-in accounts created by an administrator; passwords hashed with scrypt, sessions in HttpOnly cookies
* One shared workspace saved automatically to a SQLite database on your server
* A header indicator that shows Saved / Saving / Unsaved changes, with edits kept and resent when the server is unreachable
* A "Someone else changed this record" prompt (take theirs / keep mine) when two people edit the same record
* A "last edited by" line and recent-editor list on each assessment
* Link an account to an assessment participant; change your own password; sign out
* A one-time, optional import of an existing browser's data into an empty workspace

### Tech stack

React 19 with zustand stores in the client (built with Create React App), plus an optional Tauri desktop shell; a small Express 5
server for the AI proxy and, in multi-user mode, accounts and storage on SQLite (`better-sqlite3`).

### CSV Import and Export

#### Export CSV

The Export CSV function allows you to:

* Export your entire assessment database to a CSV file
* Include all control details, observations, scores, and action plans
* Generate date-stamped files for version control
* Add it to the companion Excel template for reporting

To export your data, click the "Export CSV" button in the controls view. The file will be automatically downloaded with a filename that includes the current date.

#### Import CSV

The Import CSV function allows you to:

* Import assessment data from a CSV file
* Update your assessment with data from external sources
* Restore from a previous export
* Collaborate by sharing and merging assessment files

**Important Note:** Importing a CSV will overwrite all data currently in the database. Make sure to export your current data first if you want to preserve it. CSV files are particularly useful for creating charts and visualizations in Excel or other spreadsheet applications.

## Navigation

The application includes several key sections:

* **Subcategories**: View and manage all CSF controls
* **Dashboard**: Visualize assessment data and progress
* **Scoring**: Reference the scoring legend and methodology
* **Artifacts**: Audit artifacts with links, to map to CSF subcategories for "test once - assure many" efficiencies
* **User Management**: Manage the participants (people named in assessments)
* **Accounts** *(multi-user mode only)*: Administrators add and disable sign-in accounts and link them to participants; everyone can change their own password

## Scoring System

The tool uses a scoring system from 0-10 to assess the current and desired state of each control. It comes from the Mastering Cyber Resilience textbook by AKYLADE.

* **0-1.9**: Insecurity - Organization rarely or never implements this control
* **2.0-4.9**: Some Security - Organization sometimes implements this control, but unreliably
* **5.0-5.9**: Minimally Acceptable Security - Organization consistently implements this control with minor flaws
* **6.1-6.9**: Optimized Security - Organization consistently implements this control with great effectiveness
* **7.0-7.9**: Fully Optimized Security - Organization implements this control with fully optimized effectiveness
* **8.1-10.0**: Too Much Security - Organization implements this control at excessive financial cost
