# INSTALL THE APP

The full-featured way to use the CSF Profile Assessment Database: run the React + Tauri desktop app locally and assess directly inside it. Best when you want the polished UI, live scoring, CSV export, and the built-in assessment workflow.

**Which mode do you get?** Everything on this page installs the **local / desktop** mode: one person, data kept in that
browser or app, nothing uploaded. If a team needs one shared workspace with accounts, that is the separate
**self-hosted multi-user** mode, which you run on your own server: see [docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](../docs/SELF_HOSTING.md)
and the [multi-user guide](../docs/MULTI_USER.md).

This is one of several ways to use the CSF Profile Assessment Database:

| Folder | When to use it |
|---|---|
| **`INSTALL_THE_APP/`** *(you are here)* | Run the desktop app locally. Recommended for active assessments. |
| [`docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`](../docs/SELF_HOSTING.md) | A team on its own server: shared workspace, accounts, data saved to a SQLite file you control. |
| `GET_THE_SPREADSHEETS/` | You just want CSV/Excel artifacts to work in spreadsheets. |
| `GET_THE_NOTION_TEMPLATE/` | You prefer to assess inside Notion. Quick-start bundle and import guide. |

## Install from your browser (no toolchain)

The web app is a Progressive Web App: open a **production copy** in Chrome or Edge — a hosted deployment, or a local build served with `npm run build` then `npx serve -s build` — and click the **install icon** in the address bar (or menu → *Install CSF Profile Assessment*). You get a standalone app window, a launcher/dock icon, and offline support: after the first visit the app opens and runs with no connection. (The `npm start` dev server deliberately skips the offline worker so hot reload never fights a cache.) In this local mode your data lives in your browser's local storage, so nothing about installing changes where data goes. (If you install a copy served by a team's multi-user server instead, your data lives on that server and you sign in; see the self-hosting guide.)

This is the fastest path on machines where you can't install Node or Rust — nothing to build, nothing to run as admin.

## Quick start

See the main [README — Installation and Setup](../README.md#installation-and-setup) for the full walkthrough. Short version:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/CPAtoCybersecurity/csf_profile.git
cd csf_profile

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the web app
npm start

# Dev (Tauri desktop)
npm run tauri dev

# Production build
npm run tauri build
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

**Desktop builds only** (skip these if you're running the web app with `npm start`):

- Rust toolchain (for Tauri desktop builds — `rustup` recommended)
- Platform tooling: Xcode CLI tools (macOS), build-essential + webkit2gtk (Linux), MSVC + WebView2 (Windows)

Full prerequisites and per-platform notes live in the main [README](../README.md).

## Troubleshooting

If the install or build fails, open an issue at <https://github.com/CPAtoCybersecurity/csf_profile/issues> with your OS, Node version, and the full error output.
