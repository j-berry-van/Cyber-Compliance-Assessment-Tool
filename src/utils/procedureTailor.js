/**
 * Tailoring of community test procedures to an organization profile.

 * Two tiers:
 *  - Deterministic (no AI, no key, offline): substitute the org's name for
 *    the fictional "Alma Security" AND re-aim tool/platform references at
 *    the org's actual stack via curated phrase maps (stackTailorMaps.js) —
 *    AWS→GCP/Azure/on-prem service analogs, EDR/email/chat product swaps.
 *    Swaps fire only on explicit profile signals: a cloud swap needs a
 *    non-AWS cloud selected without AWS; product swaps need the product
 *    named. No signal → no swap. Never guesses.
 *  - AI (optional): rewrite an attached procedure with profile context via
 *    the configured provider. Cloud providers require explicit consent
 *    (orgProfileStore.cloudConsent, per-browser) — the profile is never sent to a
 *    cloud AI provider without it. Local Ollama needs no consent.
 *
 * Any tailored output carries procedureSource.tailored = true so share
 * export can swap it back to the pristine community version (the profile
 * must not leak through derived procedure text — see PRIVATE_DATA.md).
