 * gate and the tests exercise the SAME code. The notices file is generated
 * from bank records — a hand-maintained notices file would be one more
 * per-surface re-derivation of license knowledge, the exact structure behind
 * the four historical share-export leaks.
 *
 * Deterministic by construction: banks and records render in sorted order,
 * notice text renders verbatim (reflowing a required notice is a derivative
 * of it), and nothing here reads the clock or the network — retrievedAt
 * values come from the records themselves.
