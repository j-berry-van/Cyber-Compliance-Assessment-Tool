## Assessments (Control Evaluations)

Manage multiple assessments side by side — each with its own scope, completion tracking, and import/export. The pre-loaded Alma Security assessments demonstrate the full workflow.

## Encrypted Exports (Optional Password Protection)

Some exports support optional password protection. When you choose to encrypt an export, the app prompts you for a password and downloads an encrypted file with an `.enc.csv` suffix. This is intended for secure storage/backup and will not open directly in Excel or a text editor until it is decrypted.

## Scoring Legend (Reference Tab)

The Scoring Legend provides guidance for evaluating security controls using the scoring system from Simply Cyber Academy. Color-coded rows indicate security posture: yellow for "Some Security," green for "Just Right," and red for insufficient or excessive security.

## User Management

Manage users involved in the assessment process:

## Multi-user mode screens

The screenshots above show local mode. A self-hosted multi-user build ([docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md)) adds a few screens that are not captured here: **Create the admin account** (first run) and **Sign in**, the **Accounts** page (administrators add and disable accounts and link them to participants; everyone can change their own password), the **Saved / Saving / Unsaved changes** indicator in the header, the **Someone else changed this record** conflict dialog, and an **Import this browser's data into the server?** step on a first sign-in. They are described in [docs/MULTI_USER.md](docs/MULTI_USER.md).
